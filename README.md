Projects from my Udemy Course - Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp
This is one my first project on my way to becoming a Back End Web Developer from the scratch, starting with Udemy courses to support my Open University Modules. Please note, this is the start. I have hope for better things to come.
